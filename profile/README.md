# Welcome to Rönd

Rönd is a lightweight container that distributes security policy enforcement throughout your application. The project started in 2021 within [Mia-Platform](https://github.com/mia-platform), and was launched open source in 2022 after several months of production usage. Rönd leverages [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) (OPA), the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) graduated policy engine, to allow you to set granular permissions.

# Why Rönd

As the mighty Vikings, we wanted something showing the strength of our open source project. 

We chose the Viking round shield, Rönd, which in its famous formation, the wall of shields, can block any attacks or let people pass through with "close and open" tactics.

But we wanted more. So, Inspired by the Vikings who settled in Ireland and Scotland and created an open and new culture by mixing with the local culture, we painted the Gaelic R in the center of our shields as a sign of internationality to symbolize the openness of our tools. 

To better protect ourselves we needed a helmet, like the one of Open Policy Agent, the solution at the core of Rönd. 

With Rönd you can create your own fully-equipped Viking warrior infrastructure!
