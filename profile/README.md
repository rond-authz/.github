# Welcome to Rönd

Rönd is an open source RBAC solution. The project started in 2021 within [Mia-Platform](https://github.com/mia-platform), and was launched open source in 2022 after several months of testing in production environments. Rönd leverages [Open Policy Agent](https://github.com/open-policy-agent/opa) (OPA), the [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io) graduated policy engine, to allow you to set granular permissions.

# Why Rönd

As the mighty Vikings, we wanted something showing the strength of our open source project. 

We chose the Viking round shield, Rönd, which in its famous formation, the wall of shields, can block any attacks or let people pass through with "close and open" tactics.

But we wanted more. So we added the rune of protection and defense, called Algiz. A mystical force that helps to protect your products just by adding it, nearly as our sidecar pod does with your microservices. 

To better protect ourselves we needed a helmet, like the one of Open Policy Agent, the solution at the core of Rönd. 

With Rönd you can create your own fully-equipped Viking warrior infrastructure!
